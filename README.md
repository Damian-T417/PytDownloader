*If you try to open from the exe*
- It's the same think, just open the exe (`pyt-downloader.exe`) and follow the same instructions like you open the proyect.

## In this version
- Pyt-Downloader have a executable for use in other PC without python or the libraries that need.
- You can choise the directory to save your videos or music/audios.
- Can download videos in other resolutions, but it's more experimental, just push the `Advanced search` and the program show more resolutions.

That all for this version, see you in the next **version** :)

*Notes*<br>
**important**
You may have problems with your antivirus if try to run the app, pyt-downloader it's not a virus i can sure of that, just the program download and move the file at your directory, and if advanced search is selected, moviepy renders the video.

This repository is for practice graphic interfaces in python.
Nothing important yet, probably more in the future
